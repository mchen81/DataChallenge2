# Tasks
To make the whole process clean and concise, I split up this assignment into 3 parts. 
1. [part1](/part1.ipynb): Feature engineering
2. [part2](/part2.ipynb): Model Selection
3. [part3](/part3.ipynb) Fit the chosen model and train/test dataset, make a prediction

# Description 

The part1 explains what features I picked for training. It lists different combinations of features and finds out the set that will have the most accurate prediction. The part2 not only train 4 different and compare their performance, it also make a grid search to discover the best hyper parameters. Eventually, I chose decision tree because it's the most efficient algorithm. Finally, the part3 uses the outcomes from the previous 2 parts, applies the model on the test dataset and make a final prediction.



# Prediction
The [prediction.csv](/prediction.csv) is the result made from [part3](/part3.ipynb).
